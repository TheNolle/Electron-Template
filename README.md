# ElectronJS App Template

#### What is ElectronJS

[Electron] is a [framework] for building desktop applications using [JavaScript], [HTML], and [CSS]. By embedding [Chromium] and [Node.js] into its binary, [Electron] allows you to maintain one [JavaScript] codebase and create [cross-platform apps] that work on [Windows], [MacOS], and [Linux] â€” no native development experience required.

### Samples:
1. [NoCpuMonitor]: See your CPU cores' timings in real-time with mutiple measurements.
2. [NoHashing]: Hash any string into many possible algorithms and get informations about each of them easily.
3. [NoFinance]: Get real-time finance data from [stooq].

Clone and run this repository for a quick demonstration of Electron with a custom titlebar and few utilites just for you.
This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide] within the Electron documentation but with some tweaks that you might find quite pleasing.
A basic Electron application needs just these files:
- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `index.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's main process.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's renderer process.
- preload.js - A content script that runs before the renderer process loads.
You can learn more about each of these components in depth within the official [Tutorial].

### Prerequisites
- Git
> Install [Git] for your system ([Git (Windows)], [Git (MacOS)], [Git (Linux)]).
> Check that git is correctly installed by opening a [Terminal (Windows)]/[Terminal (MacOS)]/[Terminal (Linux)] and doing `git -v`.
- NodeJS
> Install [NodeJS] (I recommend using [Node Version Manager (Linux)] or [Node Version Manager (Windows)], for MacOS i don't have any informations yet).
> Check that [NodeJS] & [npm] are correctly installed by opening a [Terminal] and doing `node -v` and `npm -v`.
